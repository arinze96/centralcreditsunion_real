                <h2>Electronic Statements and Notifications</h2>
                <p>By clicking “I Agree” below you consent and agree that Centralcreditsunion may provide certain disclosures and notices to you in electronic form, in lieu of paper form, including electronic delivery of periodic statements (e-Statements) for your Centralcreditsunion deposit account(s).</p>
                <p>This Agreement governs the receipt of your periodic account statements for those accounts that you designate (“Designated Accounts”) through Centralcreditsunion Online Banking. You agree that we may provide you with any communications that we may choose to make available in electronic format, to the extent allowed by law, and that we may discontinue sending paper communication to you, unless and until you withdraw your consent as described below. You consent to receive e-Statements in lieu of paper statements. In addition, you may receive disclosures and notices on your Designated Accounts (“Disclosures”) through the same web-based electronic service instead of by regular mail. These Disclosures may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Online Banking Agreement and any amendments thereto</li>
                    <li>Monthly account statements</li>
                    <li>Deposit account disclosures</li>
                    <li>Lending disclosures</li>
                    <li>Privacy Policy</li>
                    <li>Change-In-Terms Notices</li>
                    <li>Notice of fee changes</li>
                    <li>Fee schedules</li>
                    <li>Tax statements</li>
                    <li>Other written notices required by law</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The delivery of periodic account statements and Disclosures electronically is referred to as the “e-Statements Service.”</p>
                <p>This Agreement is in addition to all other agreements you may have with Centralcreditsunion (“Bank”) including, but not limited to, your account Terms and Conditions and the Electronic Funds Transfers Disclosure.</p>
                <h2>Delivery of e-Statements and Disclosures</h2>
                <p>Each account cycle, you will receive an e-mail at the e-mail address designated by you through Centralcreditsunion Online Banking, notifying you of the date when the e-Statements for your Designated Accounts are available. These e-mails will be the only notice you receive of the availability of your e-Statements online other than alerts that may be sent to your Online Banking message box. Viewing your e-Statements will require a valid User ID and password for Centralcreditsunion Online Banking. After signing into Online Banking, you will be provided access to your e-Statements through the Accounts tab &gt; Document menu. Access to your e- Statements will be provided for a period of at least twelve (12) months from the date of each e-Statement.</p>
                <p>By selecting e-Statements in Online Banking, you will no longer receive paper statements for your Designated Accounts by U.S. mail. In addition, you may receive Disclosures regarding Designated Accounts electronically and not in paper form. Disclosures may be attached in an e-mail, contained in the text of an e-mail, posted separately from e-Statements on the Image Document menu, contained within an e-Statement, or posted otherwise through Centralcreditsunion Online Banking. Any e-mail notifying you of the availability of, or containing an e- Statement or a Disclosure is referred to as a “Notice E-mail.” Delivery of some Disclosures in electronic form does not require the Bank to deliver all notices or all notices of a particular type electronically.</p>
                <p>Notice E-Mail to one owner of a joint owner Designated Account is considered notice to all owners. Notice E-mails will be considered sufficient notice regardless of whether you actually access the Notice E-mail or the e-Statements or Disclosures.</p>
                <h2>Hardware and Software Requirements</h2>
                <p>To access, view, and retain e-Statements your system will need to meet the following requirements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sufficient electronic storage capacity on your computer’s hard drive or other data storage unit;</li>
                    <li>Access to an email account on the Internet;</li>
                    <li>A personal computer, operating system and telecommunications connections to the Internet capable of receiving, accessing, displaying, and either printing or storing e- Statements and other Disclosures received.</li>
                    <li>A current version PDF reader, such as Adobe Reader.</li>
                    <li>A computer running the current version of any of the following web browsers: Microsoft Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, or Apple Safari.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>How to Obtain Copies</h2>

You may make a copy of an e-Statement for your records by printing it yourself or downloading it to a storage device. You may also request a mailed paper copy by calling 972-673-4000 or by emailing <a href="mailto:frontlinestaff@benchmarkbank.com">frontlinestaff@benchmarkbank.com</a>, or in person at the nearest Centralcreditsunion branch location.

Any withdrawal of your consent to receive e-Statements will be effective after a reasonable period of time to process your withdrawal.</p>
                <h2>Termination/Changes</h2>

The Bank will provide you with notice of any such termination or change as required by law. It may be necessary to change the terms or conditions regarding your statement access. In such an event, the Bank will notify you via e-mail or U.S. Mail.</p>
                <h2>Federal Law</h2>
                <p>You acknowledge and agree that your consent to this Agreement is being provided in connection with a transaction affecting interstate commerce that is subject to the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, and that you and the Bank both intend that the Act apply to the fullest extent possible to validate our ability to conduct business with you by electronic means.</p>
